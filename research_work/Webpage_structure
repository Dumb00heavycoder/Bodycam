PART 1 — BUILDING A SECURE WEBPAGE (BEGINNER LEVEL)
1. What the Webpage Actually Is

The webpage is just a user interface.

It:

Shows login screen

Shows dashboard

Sends requests like:

“Get footage for this police ID and date”

Displays results

It does NOT:

Store passwords

Access database directly

Handle security rules

2. Webpage Structure (Simple)

Your webpage has 3 screens:

Screen 1: Login Page

Fields:

Username

Password

Screen 2: Dashboard

Shows:

Total police registered

Total bodycams active

Total footages stored

Recent access logs

Screen 3: Footage Fetch Page

Inputs:

Police ID (UPP-ID)

Date range

Request / approval ID

Button:

“Fetch Footage”

3. How Login Works (Very Important)
Step-by-step (simple language):

User enters username + password

Webpage sends this to backend:

POST /api/login


Backend:

Checks username/password in database

If correct → creates a token

Backend sends token back

Webpage stores token (temporarily)

Every future request includes this token

This token proves:

“This user is authenticated”

4. Technology for Webpage (Beginner Friendly)

Use:

HTML → structure

CSS → design

JavaScript → logic

React.js → makes UI easier (recommended)

Do NOT use:

PHP login systems

Direct database queries

Client-side authentication

PART 2 — BACKEND SERVER (THE MOST IMPORTANT PART)

This is the brain of the system.

1. What Backend Does

The backend:

Handles login

Enforces access rules

Talks to database

Logs every access

Connects bodycams to storage

Backend language:

Java + Spring Boot

2. Backend Components (Conceptual)
Controller → Service → Database
               ↓
           Access Logs

Controller

Receives web requests:

Login

Fetch data

Upload metadata

Service

Business rules:

Is user allowed?

Is approval ID valid?

Should access be logged?

Repository

Talks to database safely

3. Login & Security (Beginner Explanation)

Passwords are:

NEVER stored as plain text

Stored as hashed values

Process:

User enters password

Backend hashes it

Compares with stored hash

If match → login success

Security method:

JWT token (digital pass)

4. Fetching Footage (Step-by-Step)

When admin fetches footage:

Webpage sends:

GET /api/footage


With:

UPP-ID

Date

Approval reference

Backend:

Validates token

Checks admin role

Queries database:

Find matching footage

Logs access in access_logs

Returns metadata + secure link

Webpage displays result

Footage is never directly downloaded unless authorized.

PART 3 — DATABASE (WHAT YOU ALREADY DESIGNED)

Your database contains:

Police personnel

Bodycams

Footage metadata

Access logs

ID sequences

Important rule:

Database is accessed only by backend

1. How Backend Connects to Database

Backend uses:

JDBC (Java Database Connector)

Credentials stored securely

Connection flow:

Backend → PostgreSQL → Result → Backend → Webpage


No frontend involvement.

2. Example Query Flow

Admin requests footage:

Backend runs:

SELECT * FROM footage_metadata
WHERE upp_id = 'UPP-2018-LKO-004512'
AND recording_start::date = '2025-01-01';


Then logs:

INSERT INTO access_logs (...)

PART 4 — BODYCAM TO DATABASE CONNECTION (IMPORTANT)

This is where beginners get confused.
Let’s simplify.

1. Bodycam Does NOT Upload to Database

Bodycam uploads to:

Backend API

NOT to database directly.

2. Bodycam Upload Flow (Very Clear)
Bodycam
   ↓ (encrypted upload)
Backend API
   ↓
Cloud Storage (video file)
   ↓
Database (metadata only)

3. What Bodycam Sends

Bodycam sends:

Video file (encrypted)

Bodycam ID

Timestamp

GPS

Officer UPP-ID

4. What Backend Does with Bodycam Data

Receives encrypted video

Stores video in cloud storage

Generates hash (SHA-256)

Stores metadata in database:

UPP-ID

Storage path

Hash

Time

Links footage permanently to officer

Bodycam cannot edit or delete anything.

5. How Bodycam Authenticates

Each bodycam has:

Device ID

Secret key (burned into hardware)

Backend checks:

“Is this a valid registered bodycam?”

Only then upload allowed.

PART 5 — AUTOMATIC UPLOAD (NO MANUAL ACTION)

Once recording ends:

Bodycam auto-uploads

No officer intervention

No local deletion option

If network fails:

Bodycam caches encrypted file

Uploads when docked or network returns

PART 6 — LOGGING & AUDIT (CRITICAL)

Every access creates a record:

Who accessed
Which footage
Why
When
From where


This:

Protects officers

Prevents misuse

Satisfies courts
